# NileShop
This project involves creating a standalone Java GUI application that simulates an e-store called Nile Dot Com. The application allows users to place items into a shopping cart, total costs including tax, produce an invoice, and append transactions to a log file.


## Features

- User-friendly GUI with data input fields, shopping cart view, and six functional buttons.
- Inventory management using an input file (inventory.csv).
- Logging transactions in an output file (transactions.csv).
- Handles up to 5 separate items per transaction.
- Includes error handling for out-of-stock items and invalid item entries.
- Displays current order details and final invoice upon checkout.
